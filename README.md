# OTFS-based-on-OFDM-System (Study the performance of OTFS based on the OFDM System)
The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in terms of throughput, latency, and spectral efficiency. The project will use MATLAB to simulate both modulation schemes and compare their performance.

In order to run this project, MATLAB must be installed on the user's computer. Additionally, the user must have a basic understanding of MATLAB programming and communication systems.
